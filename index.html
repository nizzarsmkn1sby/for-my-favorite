            <p>It started with boredom.</p>
            <p>
              Just another day. Nothing special. I opened Telegram, scrolling
              mindlessly, looking for something—anything—to fill the void.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I did what any bored person would do: I posted on a menfess.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">"Looking for someone to talk to."</p>
            <p>I didn't expect much. Maybe a few replies. Maybe nothing at all.</p>
            <p>But then... someone replied.</p>
            <p class="large-text">Dira.</p>
            <p>
              We talked. We called. And honestly? It was... okay. Just okay.
              Nothing extraordinary. Just two strangers passing time.
            </p>
            <p>I hung up. Went about my day. Had things to do.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">
              I thought that was it. Just another random conversation that would
              fade into nothing.
            </p>

          <div class="story-text">
            <p>Later that evening—or was it around 6 PM?—I was bored again.</p>
            <p>Without thinking much, I sent a message:</p>
            <p class="emphasis">"I'm bored. Want to go out?"</p>
            <p>
              I expected a "no." Maybe a "I'm busy." Maybe just silence.
            </p>
            <p>But Dira replied:</p>
            <p class="large-text">"Sure. Where?"</p>
            <p>Wait. What?</p>
            <p>
              "Kopi Djaja?" I typed, still not believing this was actually
              happening.
            </p>
            <p>"Okay."</p>
            <p>
              And then reality hit me. I didn't have a motorcycle.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't have a bike," I admitted, expecting that to be the end of it.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">"I'll pick you up."</p>
            <p class="large-text">And Dira actually did.</p>
            <p>
              I stood there, watching Dira pull up, and I couldn't believe it.
              This person—who I'd just met—actually came to pick me up.
            </p>
            <p>For a casual hangout. Like it was nothing.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">
              That's when I realized... this wasn't just another random person.

            <p>Kopi Djaja was packed. Too crowded. Too loud.</p>
            <p>
              "Let's go somewhere else," Dira suggested. We ended up at a
              warkop—a bit more elite, quieter, more... intimate.
            </p>
            <p>And that's when we really started talking.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">Not small talk. Real talk.</p>
            <p>
              We shared stories about our lives. Our struggles. Our dreams. Our
              fears. Things I don't usually tell people I just met.
            </p>
            <p>But with Dira? It felt... easy. Natural.</p>
            <p>That was the first time.</p>
            <p class="large-text">Then we went out again. And again. And again.</p>
            <p>
              By the fourth time, something had shifted. I wasn't just hanging
              out with someone to kill time anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">I was comfortable. I was... happy.</p>
            <p>
              And then a thought crept into my mind, quiet but persistent:
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">"Should I confess?"</p>
            <p>
              But I held back. I didn't want to assume. Didn't want to be that
              person who gets ahead of themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">So I waited. And I watched. And I hoped.</p>

              We talked about everything. Family. Relationships. Love. The kind
              of conversations you have when you're trying to understand if
              someone sees the world the way you do.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">And Dira did. Dira understood.</p>
            <p>
              We talked about being overlooked by our families. About feeling
              like we don't matter. About carrying pain that no one else sees.
            </p>
            <p>We talked about what we wanted in a partner. In love. In life.</p>
            <p>And with every word, I felt it.</p>
            <p class="large-text emphasis">Found the one.</p>
            <p>
              That feeling when everything just... clicks. When you realize this
              person isn't just someone you're hanging out with.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">This is someone you could fall for.</p>

              But I still held back. I didn't want to rush. Didn't want to ruin
              what we had by being too eager.
            </p>
            <p>So I kept it inside.</p>

              rationalize away—it had grown too strong.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">I had to tell Dira how I felt.</p>
            <p>So on November 29, 2025, I did something I'd never done before.</p>
            <p class="large-text">I confessed.</p>
            <p>I gave Dira chocolate. My hands were shaking. My heart was racing.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">We became a couple.</p>
            <p>
              But honestly? At first, it didn't feel like a typical relationship.
              It felt more like... two people just hanging out. Like nothing had
              really changed.
            </p>
            <p>I remember thinking:</p>
            <p class="large-text">"Is this really a relationship?"</p>
            <p>
              So we talked about it. We decided to change our approach. To make
              it feel more... real. More intentional.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">And that? That was the right decision.</p>
            <p>
              Because now, when I'm with Dira, it doesn't feel like just hanging
              out anymore.
